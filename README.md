# V√ÑKI - Your AI Coding Assistant

> **Stop manually implementing GitHub issues. Let AI do it for you.**

V√ÑKI reads your GitHub issues, implements the changes, and creates pull requests automatically. Think of it as having a junior developer who works 24/7 and never gets tired.

---

## What Does It Do?

**The Simple Version:**
1. You have a GitHub issue that needs implementation
2. Run one command: `python main.py run myproject 42`
3. V√ÑKI implements the changes and creates a PR
4. You review and merge

**Real Example:**
```
Issue #42: "Add dark mode toggle to settings"

$ python main.py run myproject 42 --mode=openai

... 3 minutes later ...

‚úÖ Pull Request created: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123
   - 3 files changed
   - All tests passing
   - Ready for review
```

---

## Why Use V√ÑKI?

### The Problem
- You have a backlog of small bugs and features
- You spend hours on repetitive implementations
- Context switching between tickets is exhausting
- Junior developers need constant code review

### The Solution
- V√ÑKI handles routine implementations automatically
- You focus on architecture and complex features
- Consistent code quality (follows your standards)
- Safe rollback if something goes wrong

**Real Impact:**
- Teams save 5-10 hours per week on routine tasks
- Faster time to resolution for simple bugs
- More time for creative problem-solving

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Install

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/your-org/vaki
cd vaki
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure

Create `.env` file:
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk_your_key_here
```

Create `projects/myproject.yml`:
```yaml
name: myproject
github:
  repo: your-org/your-repo
  base_branch: main
filters:
  assignee: your-username
  state: open
context: contexts/myproject.md  # Optional
```

### 3. Run

```bash
# Process a specific issue
python main.py run myproject 42 --mode=openai

# Or process all assigned issues
python main.py run myproject --mode=openai
```

**That's it!** V√ÑKI will implement the issue and create a PR.

## How It Works

V√ÑKI has three modes depending on how much control you want:

### ü§ñ OpenAI Mode (Recommended)
**Fully automated** - Just run and review the PR later

```bash
python main.py run myproject 42 --mode=openai
```

**What happens:**
1. Reads your GitHub issue
2. Analyzes your codebase to understand the project
3. Generates multiple implementation strategies
4. Picks the best one and implements it
5. Runs tests and quality checks
6. Creates a pull request

**Best for:** Bug fixes, small features, routine tasks

**Time saved:** 30 min - 2 hours per issue

---

### üë§ Claude Mode (Human-in-the-Loop)
**Semi-automated** - You guide, Claude helps

```bash
python main.py run myproject 42
```

**What happens:**
1. Fetches issue and creates branch
2. Opens Claude Code CLI with full context
3. You work with Claude to implement
4. Creates PR when you're done

**Best for:** Complex features, architectural changes, learning

---

### üìã Manual Ticket Mode (Multi-Tool Teams)
**Process tickets from anywhere** - Slack, email, Jira, etc.

```bash
# Copy message from Slack
python main.py ticket myproject --source=slack
# Paste message, press Ctrl+D
# PR created!
```

**What happens:**
1. Paste text from any source (Slack, email, Jira)
2. V√ÑKI parses it like a GitHub issue
3. Implements and creates PR

**Best for:** Ad-hoc requests, teams using multiple tools

## Configuration

### Basic (Good Enough)

This is all you need to get started:

```yaml
# projects/myproject.yml
name: myproject
github:
  repo: your-org/your-repo
  base_branch: main
filters:
  assignee: your-username
  state: open
```

### Advanced (Production-Ready)

Add these for enterprise features:

```yaml
# Quality control
quality:
  mode: "standard"  # Ensures tests pass, code is clean

# Budget limits
resources:
  daily_cost_limit: 50.00      # Max spend per day
  per_issue_cost_limit: 10.00  # Max spend per issue

# Smart features
ticket_analysis:
  enabled: true  # Checks if issue is clear enough
implementation:
  multi_strategy: true  # Tries multiple approaches
learning:
  enabled: true  # Gets better over time
```

**See example:** [projects/example-enhanced.yml](projects/example-enhanced.yml)

## Common Questions

### Is it safe?

Yes! V√ÑKI:
- ‚úÖ Never pushes to main directly (always creates PRs)
- ‚úÖ Runs your tests before creating PRs
- ‚úÖ Can rollback changes if something goes wrong
- ‚úÖ You review everything before merging

### How much does it cost?

Typical costs with GPT-5.0:
- Small bug fix: $1-2
- Medium feature: $3-6
- Large feature: $8-15

You can set budget limits to control costs.

### Will it replace developers?

No! V√ÑKI is best at:
- ‚úÖ Routine bug fixes
- ‚úÖ Simple feature implementations
- ‚úÖ Following existing patterns

You're still needed for:
- ‚ùå Architecture decisions
- ‚ùå Complex algorithms
- ‚ùå Creative solutions
- ‚ùå Code review and quality

Think of it as an assistant, not a replacement.

### What if it makes a mistake?

1. **You review the PR** before merging (always!)
2. If wrong, just close the PR
3. V√ÑKI learns from feedback
4. Budget limits prevent runaway costs

### Can I use my own coding standards?

Yes! Create `contexts/myproject.md` with your standards:

```markdown
# Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Write tests for all features
- Follow our component patterns
- Use Tailwind for styling
```

V√ÑKI will follow your rules.
